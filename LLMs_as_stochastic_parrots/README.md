# Large Language Models as Stochastic Parrots

### Introduction

- The race to build bigger, faster, and more capable AI models is pushing organizations to stretch the limits of current technology.
- Significant resources and investments are being directed toward achieving breakthroughs in AI capabilities.
- As a result, we are seeing the rapid release of increasingly larger and more powerful models.

### Moore's Law for Large Language Models

- A variation of Moore's Law has emerged in the context of large language models, suggesting that the size of these models is increasing **10Ã— every year**.
