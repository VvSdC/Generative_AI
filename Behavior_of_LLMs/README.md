# Understanding the Behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and others are becoming a big part of our daily work and lives. It’s natural to think that LLMs:
<li> Help extract information quickly </li>
<li> Unlock the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) </li>
<li> Boost efficiency at work </li>
<li> Personalize our experiences </li>
<li> Automate repetitive tasks </li>
<li> Assist in writing test code </li>
<li> Summarize articles, research papers, and other documents </li>

<br>

But it’s equally important to ask deeper questions:
<li> Can we always trust the answers given by LLMs? </li>
<li> Should we verify the facts they provide? </li>
<li> Could LLMs unintentionally (or intentionally) manipulate information? </li>
<li> What are the hidden costs (money, time, energy) behind using them? </li>
<li> Are there tasks where humans still outperform LLMs? </li>
<li> Is using an LLM always the best choice? </li>

<br>

At first, these questions might sound odd. But once you dive into how LLMs actually work, these concerns start to make a lot of sense.  
Understanding their behavior makes us smarter users of these tools.

# How Language Models Work (A Simple Explanation)

At their core, <b>language models predict the next word (or part of a word) based on what came before.</b>

More formally:
<li> A language model assigns a probability to a sequence of tokens (small pieces of words or characters).</li>

<br>

Imagine this:
<li> You have a "vocabulary" — a collection of all possible tokens (words or parts of words) the model knows.</li>
<li> Let's call it V = {token1, token2, ..., tokenN}.</li>
<li> You can arrange these tokens in many different sequences.</li>
<li> The language model calculates how likely each sequence is to happen.</li>
<li> The higher the probability, the more "natural" or "correct" the sentence sounds.</li>

<br>

# Example

Suppose the vocabulary contains:
<b>V = {earth, the, is, planet, a, spherical}</b>

The language model might assign probabilities like this:
<li> P(the, earth, is, a, spherical, planet) → very high probability ✅ </li>
<li> P(a, spherical, planet, is, the, earth) → medium probability </li>
<li> P(a, the, is, earth, spherical, planet) → low probability ❌ </li>

<br>

Thus, the model would prefer to generate the first sequence because it sounds more natural and meaningful.

<br>

> <b>In short:</b><br>
> LLMs don't "understand" language the way humans do — they are <b>guessing</b> the most likely next word based on patterns they've seen during training.

<br>

# Must-Have Skills for a Language Model

<li>
<b>Syntactic Knowledge</b><br>
This helps the language model understand how words can be combined to form meaningful sentences, phrases, or utterances.  
In simple words, it’s about knowing the "grammar rules" of language.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>World Knowledge</b><br>
This gives the model an understanding of many different subjects, real-world facts, and common sense.  
It helps the model make connections across various knowledge areas.
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Linguistic Knowledge</b><br>
This means knowing detailed information about words — their meanings, relationships, synonyms, grammar, and how they fit together.  
It allows the model to use language more accurately and naturally.
</li>
<br>

# Training a Large Language Model

A large language model is trained on a massive amount of text data.  
This training data is collected from many sources, such as:

<li> Open data available publicly on the internet </li>
<li> Well-known common datasets created for research and AI training </li>
<li> Specially gathered collections like books, encyclopedias, articles, and sometimes even social media posts </li>
<br>
The more diverse and rich the training data, the better the model becomes at understanding and generating human-like language.
